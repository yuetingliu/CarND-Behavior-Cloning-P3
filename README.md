Overview
---
This is my solution to the 3rd project of Udacity self-driving-car nanodegree term1. A detailed writeup report about my solution can be found in [writeup_report.md](https://github.com/yuetingliu/CarND-Behavior-Cloning-P3/blob/master/writeup_report.md).


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This solution requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

### Data pre-processing, Model Architecture, and Training Strategy

#### 1. Data pre-processing

The data I use consists of two parts. One part is the data provided by Udacity, and the other is the data of my own driving in the simulator.
 
The data is pre-processed before feeding into the model. The pre-processing consists of four steps, cropping, resizing, converting to HSV, and brightness distortion.
The brightness distortion is only applied in training mode. In inference mode, it is off.

#### 2. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model resembles architecture used in the [Nvidia end to end self-driving paper](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/).
The architecture consists of five convolution neural network with three 5x5 filter sizes and two 3X3 filter sizes. The depths are between 24 and 64 (model.py lines 180-184). 
The activation functions for all conv layers are ELU. The data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (model.py code line 179). The model contains three fully
connected layers followed by the output layer (model.py code 188-192).  

#### 3. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains two dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 187, 191). 

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting. The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 4. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, but the learning rate was reduced to 0.0001 instead of the default 0.001 (model.py line 194).

#### 5. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road, and augmented data. 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 


#### 6. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to improve the results through iterations. 

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the LeNet. I thought this model might be appropriate because LeNet worked well in extracting features from images, and it is simple to implement and run.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set (5% validation set). I found that my first model could not make to car to drive autonomously. 
Then, I adopted the model from the [Nvidia paper](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/). The results were reasonably well after some tweaks.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle drove off the track. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I set a correction value (The value 
compensation for the images seen by left and right cameras). Through trail and error, I chose the values 0.25 (for left camera) and -0.25 (for right camera).

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 7. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 179-192) consisted of a convolution neural network illustrated below

#### 8. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

I used both the data provided by Udacity and the data of my own driving in the simulator. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles to simply gain more data. For example, here is an image illustration. The left is the original image, and the right is the flipped image:

After the collection process, I had 71364 data points. But the distribution of the data was pretty bad, which was responsible for the unsuccessful autonomous driving. 
I then removed some data to make the distribution more reasonable. The removal is done with the function 'trim_data()'. The algorithm first splits all the data into 40 bins, then calculates the number of counts in each bin. For the counts that larger than the cutoff, 
a probability is calculated to remove some data until the counts of that bin is comparable to the adjacent two bins. The following image shows the distribution before and after trimming (left: original distribution; right: after trimming).

I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 5% of the data into a validation set (with the function train_validation_split())

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 10 as evidenced by both training and validation losses stopped dropping noticeably.
